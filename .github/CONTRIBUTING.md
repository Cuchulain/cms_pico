Contributing to Pico CMS for Nextcloud
======================================

Pico aims to be a high quality Content Management System (CMS) but at the same time wants to give contributors freedom when submitting fixes or improvements.

By contributing to Pico, you accept and agree to the *Developer Certificate of Origin* (DCO) for your present and future contributions submitted to Pico. Please refer to the ["Developer Certificate of Origin" section](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin) in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` of our main repository.

Due to historic reasons and by way of derogation from Pico's main project, Pico CMS for Nextcloud is being developed under the terms of the *GNU Affero General Public License v3.0* (AGPL-3.0). All contributions to Pico CMS for Nextcloud are subject to the DCO and the AGPL-3.0. In conformation with the Nextcloud project, it is required to sign your commits before contributing your work to Pico CMS for Nextcloud. If you can certify both the DCO and the AGPL-3.0, then just add a line to every git commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

Aside from this, we want to *encourage*, but not obligate you, the contributor, to follow our contribution guidelines. Having said that: we really appreciate it when you apply the guidelines in part or wholly as that will save us time which, in turn, we can spend on bugfixes and new features. Please refer to the [`CONTRIBUTING.md` of our main repository](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for our actual contribution guidelines.
